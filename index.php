                        <p>Team Knight Ryders was established in 2018 after Chrystal had participated in five Cowalunga Bike Tours and wanted to start a team for the event. She wanted to be able to do more fundraising for Respiratory Health Association and thought having a team of her own would help accomplish that goal.</p>
                        <p >Team Knight Ryders participate in various physical fitness charity events throughout the year. By participating in these events we help raise funds for Respiratory Health Association, Muscular Dystrophy Association, The American Lung Association, as well as many others.</p>
                        <p>RHA offers Asthma Management, a one-hour program for caregivers of children with asthma, to schools and in community settings. Courage to Quit is a RHA's integrated tobacco intervention program.</p>
